        <h3>Hi {{ login }}! </h3>

        <p>
        <p>
            It's somewhat like Tinder.<br>
            a) you share this with all your friends here on <a href="https://mokum.place">Mokum</a>;<br>
            b) you enter into the form the usernames of some of them you won't mind getting intimate with;<br>
            c) your friends do b) as well;<br>
            d) if there's a match - you both get notified, and, well, can meet and know each other a bit better.<br>
            You can also subscribe to <a href="https://mokum.place/barankas">@barankas</a> to get notifications from
            the service as direct messages.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You get 5 attempts for the first time, 2 attempts for the second time, and only one for the
            third
            time. <br>
            There is a 100k seconds (27 hours) timeout after you spend all attempts, so you have time to think
            and
            make wise choices. <br>
            After the third batch you won't get new attempts for about a month. <br>
            Each time you get an incoming crush - you'll get one extra attempt to guess it. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You can revoke an used try and convert it back to attempt, but you can do this once a week <br>
            You also can poke user with Poke function but also - once ~a week.
            <br>

        </p>
